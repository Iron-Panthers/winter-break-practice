> If you don't recognize this file format, it's called markdown. It's a way to format text that's easy to read and write in plain text. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). It won't look very pretty in a text editor, but it's great for writing documentation in a code repository. If you're in VS Code, you can click the preview button in the upper right corner.

Welcome to the second part of this practice :D
Hopefully you've done the first part and passed with flying colours (im brittish idk how to spell colors)
Take this simple inheritance code in change it in these ways (you can be **creative**)

1. Complete all of the TODOs in the Person Class
2. Create a new class called `Adult` that inherits from `Person`
3. Create a new class called `Child` that inherits from `Person`
4. Create a new class called `Baby` that inherits from `Person`
5. Create a new method in the `Person` class called `greet` that prints "Hello, my name is {name}"
6. Using ovveriding, create a new method in the `Adult` class called `greet` that prints "Hello, my name is {name} and I am an adult"
7. Modify greet in the `Child` class to print "Hello, my name is {name} and I am a child"
8. Do the same thing for the Baby class, but print "Hello, my name is {name} and I am a baby"
9. Add 2 additional methods to the `Person` class of your choosing and override them in the `Adult`, `Child`, and `Baby` classes
