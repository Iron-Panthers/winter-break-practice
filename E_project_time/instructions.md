# Project Time Instructions

Hi again :D

Do you know what time it is??

It's project time!

In this challenge, I challenge you to make the craziest project you can think of. (craziest project wins and gets a shoutout on slack)

---

Here are some ideas (I wan't this to be a larger scale project, so don't just make a simple calculator or tic tac toe game):

1. PONG (you can use a graphics library like java.awt or swing)
2. A simple 2D game (like a platformer or a top down shooter)
3. Chess (you can do this using a graphics library or just text in the console)
4. An AI chatbot (don't worry about machine learning, just make it respond to certain keywords with a few phrases, lookup Eugene Goostman for inspiration)
5. Anything else you can think of that would be cool (be creative, you've got all break to work on this. but have fun with it)

Rules

- Use java
- Don't use any outside libraries (you can use the standard java libraries)
- NO CHATGPT (Use you're own brain)
- Have fun with it (this isn't forced and is just for fun, don't take it seriously)
